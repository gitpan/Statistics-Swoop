=head1 NAME

Statistics::Swoop - getting basic stats of a list in one fell swoop


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::Swoop;

    my @list = (qw/1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10/);
    my $ss = Statistics::Swoop->new(\@list);

    print $ss->max;   # 10
    print $ss->min;   # 1
    print $ss->sum;   # 55
    print $ss->avg;   # 5.5
    print $ss->range; # 9


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Usually, If we calculate some stats from list, we want maximum/minimum/sum/average/range. So Statistics::Swoop calculates them at only one loop.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new($list)

constractor

=head2 max, maximum

getting the maximum value in $list

=head2 min, minimum

getting the minimum value in $list

=head2 range

getting the range value in $list

=head2 sum

getting the sum in $list

=head2 avg, average

getting the average in $list

=head2 count

getting the count of element

=head2 result

getting the all results as hash


=head1 BENCHMARK

See the source in this modules directory(demos/*.pl).

=head2 Statistics::Swoop vs Statistics::Lite

    $ perl demos/benchmark.pl
    Benchmark: running Lite, Swoop for at least 1 CPU seconds...
          Lite:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.09 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.09 CPU) @ 110.09/s (n=120)
         Swoop:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.07 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.07 CPU) @ 313.08/s (n=335)
           Rate  Lite Swoop
    Lite  110/s    --  -65%
    Swoop 313/s  184%    --

C<Statistics::Swoop> is 170-190% faster than L<Statistics::Lite>.
Actually, when you calculate very small list, then L<Statistics::Lite> is bit faster than C<Statistics::Swoop>.
